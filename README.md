# ArtworkManagerFinal
Assignment developed for a technical interview.

This project is a simple web application for managing artworks, with CRUD options for artworks and Register, Login/Logout and password recovery for users.

I had some experience with Entity Framework before but it was the first time I did a full application from the ground up.
